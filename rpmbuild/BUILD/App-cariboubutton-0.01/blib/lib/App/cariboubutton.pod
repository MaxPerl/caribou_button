=head1 NAME

App::CaribouButton - A "Show Keyboard" Button for the GNOME Caribou on screen keyboard

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A "Show Keyboard" Button for the GNOME Caribou on screen keyboard. The button is displayed always on top at the right bottom of the screen and is useful for touchscreen users if the Caribou on screen keyboard doesn't pop up (e.g. at non Gtk3 Applications such as Firefox or Chromium).

=head2 IMPORTANT NOTES

=over 4

=item 1)

To autostart the caribou button you have to create a file cariboubutton.desktop in the directory /$HOMEDIRECTORY/.config/autostart with the following content:

[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=Caribou Button
Exec=/usr/local/bin/caribou_button.pl # or the path where you copied the script (see above)

You can find an example .desktop file in the per-module share directory which you can easily copy to /$HOMEDIRECTORY/.config/autostart. The per-module share directory can be for example located in /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/auto/share/module/App-cariboubutton/. The name of that directory can be recovered with "module_dir" in File::ShareDir.

=item 2) 

At the moment it seems that the keyboard pops only up if yo click the button with the touchscreen, not with a normal mouse. A normal mouse click opens the on screen keyboard only if the on screen keyboard is generally enabled in the Accessibility settings. I don't know why the button behaves in such manner, but the main purpose of this little script is to help touchscreen users, so that this behavior will not be changed in the next time.
